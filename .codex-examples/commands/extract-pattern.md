I just discovered a useful pattern. Help me document it:

Pattern: ${PATTERN_NAME}

What I did:
${DESCRIPTION}

Create a pattern file in docs/patterns/${CATEGORY}/ following the template:
- Context: When to use
- Problem: What it solves
- Solution: How to apply
- Trade-offs: Pros, cons, alternatives
- Examples: Real scenarios

Also update docs/playbook/scenarios.md with quick reference.
