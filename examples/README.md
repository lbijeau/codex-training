# Code Examples

Runnable examples demonstrating key patterns from the training program.

## Purpose

These examples help you:
- See patterns in action
- Practice with working code
- Reference during exercises
- Experiment safely

## Structure

```
examples/
├── speed/          # Performance and efficiency examples
├── quality/        # Code quality and testing examples
├── planning/       # Planning and workflow examples
└── README.md       # This file
```

## How to Use

### Running Examples

Most examples are standalone and can be run directly:

```bash
cd examples/speed
node parallel-execution-example.js
```

Or use them as reference when working through exercises.

### Modifying Examples

Feel free to:
- Modify examples to experiment
- Add your own examples
- Combine patterns
- Use as templates for exercises

### Adding Your Own

When you discover a useful pattern:

1. Create example in appropriate directory
2. Add clear comments explaining the pattern
3. Keep it focused on one concept
4. Make it runnable if possible

## Example Categories

### Speed Examples

Demonstrations of:
- Parallel vs sequential execution
- Context optimization techniques
- Multi-agent coordination
- Background processing

### Quality Examples

Demonstrations of:
- TDD workflow
- Multi-layer review
- Test patterns
- Code quality checks

### Planning Examples

Demonstrations of:
- Stage-based planning
- TodoWrite usage
- Progress tracking
- Implementation plans

## Contributing

Add examples that would have helped you understand a pattern faster.

Good examples:
- ✅ Focused on one pattern
- ✅ Well-commented
- ✅ Runnable (when possible)
- ✅ Clear purpose stated

Avoid:
- ❌ Complex multi-pattern examples
- ❌ Uncommented code
- ❌ Overly trivial examples
- ❌ Production code dumps
