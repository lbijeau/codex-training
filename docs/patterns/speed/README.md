## Quick Tips

1. **Default to parallel**: When operations are independent, execute in parallel
2. **Minimize round-trips**: Batch requests when possible
3. **Use targeted tools**: Grep before Read, limit file reads
4. **Coordinate parallel investigations**: Run independent prompts or helper threads for each concern
5. **Leverage background**: Long-running processes don't block main flow
