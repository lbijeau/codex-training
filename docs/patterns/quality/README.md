1. **Review before committing**: Spawn code-reviewer agent after implementation
2. **Test first**: Write tests before implementation when possible
3. **Multiple checks**: Use different agent types for comprehensive review
4. **Automate with hooks**: Quality checks can run automatically
5. **Verify, don't assume**: Always confirm tests pass
