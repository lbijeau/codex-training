# Pattern Library

A growing collection of proven patterns for working with Codex Code.

## Organization

Patterns are organized by category:

- **[Speed](speed/)**: Patterns for faster execution and efficiency
- **[Quality](quality/)**: Patterns for code quality and verification
- **[Debugging](debugging/)**: Patterns for systematic problem-solving
- **[Planning](planning/)**: Patterns for task decomposition and execution
- **[Architecture](architecture/)**: Patterns for design and exploration

## Using This Library

Each pattern includes:
- **When to use**: Situations where this pattern applies
- **How to apply**: Step-by-step implementation
- **Trade-offs**: Pros, cons, and alternatives
- **Examples**: Real-world usage scenarios

## Contributing Patterns

As you work through the exercises and discover new patterns:

1. Create a new markdown file in the appropriate category
2. Use the pattern template (see below)
3. Link it from the category README
4. Cross-reference related patterns
