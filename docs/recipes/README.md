# Codex CLI Cookbook

Outcome-focused guides and prompts that connect you to core workflows in the Codex CLI curriculum. These recipes are lighter than full modules—grab one when you want to solve a specific problem without jumping into a full lesson.

## Available Recipes

- **RAG & Infinite Context** - Retrieval-augmented generation for large projects (`/recipes/rag`)

More recipes (planning, quality, speed, etc.) will land here once they are refreshed for Codex; for now the RAG recipe is the only one in the cookbook.
- [RAG & Infinite Context](./rag.md) - retrieval-augmented generation for large projects
