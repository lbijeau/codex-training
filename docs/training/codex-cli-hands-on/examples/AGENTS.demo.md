# Training AGENTS guidance (demo)

- Keep changes scoped to the current repo; do not touch parent directories.
- Always show a plan and a diff before writing files. Minimize edits.
- Avoid package manager/network commands unless explicitly requested.
- Prefer tests or linters after code changes; if unavailable, state how you would validate.
- If unsure about context, ask before running commands or writing files.
