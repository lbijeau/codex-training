# Checklists

Step-by-step workflows for common tasks.

## How to Use

1. Find the relevant checklist
2. Follow steps in order
3. Check off as you complete
4. Add your own checklists as you discover workflows

## Example: Coordinating Parallel Investigations

- [ ] Identify independent investigations that can run separately
- [ ] Define the helper functions or prompt templates each thread will use
- [ ] Gather summaries or helper outputs for each thread
- [ ] Feed the summaries into a synthesis prompt
- [ ] Review the combined result and document next steps

**When to use**: Multiple independent concerns (bugs, performance checks, security reviews) could benefit from parallel exploration

## Example: Optimizing for Speed

- [ ] Identify all required operations
- [ ] Check for dependencies between operations
- [ ] Group independent operations for parallel execution
- [ ] Execute dependent operations sequentially
- [ ] Verify token usage improvement
- [ ] Note time savings

**When to use**: Multiple file reads, searches, or independent checks needed
