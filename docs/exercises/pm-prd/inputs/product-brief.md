# Product Brief: Support Intake Triage

## Context
Support requests are growing faster than the team can triage them. The current workflow uses a shared inbox and manual tagging.

## Goals
- Reduce time to first response by 30%
- Improve triage consistency across team members
- Provide visibility into recurring issue categories

## Constraints
- No new headcount this quarter
- Must integrate with existing ticket system

## Notes
Recent retrospectives cite "slow triage" and "unclear ownership" as top pain points.
