# Exercise 2: Goals, Non-Goals, and Constraints

## Objective
Define clear goals and non-goals that align to the problem statement.

## Background
Goals clarify success. Non-goals prevent scope creep. Constraints keep delivery realistic.

## Part A: Draft Goals

**Task**: Write 2-3 goals for the PRD.

1. Open `practice/pm-prd/prd.md`.
2. Fill in **Goals** with 2-3 measurable outcomes.
3. Add at least one constraint in **Non-Goals** (what this effort will not do).

## Part B: Cite Evidence

Add at least one citation for your goals in **Evidence / Sources**.

## Self-Check
- Goals are measurable and aligned to the problem
- Non-goals explicitly exclude tempting scope
- Constraints are realistic for a first release
