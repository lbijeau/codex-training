# Exercise 1: Problem Statement from Evidence

## Objective
Draft a problem statement grounded in repo evidence.

## Background
Strong PRDs start with an evidence-backed problem statement. This exercise builds that habit by citing repo sources.

## Part A: Gather Evidence

**Task**: Read the provided inputs and identify the core user problem.

1. Read the sample inputs:
   - `docs/exercises/pm-prd/inputs/product-brief.md`
   - `docs/exercises/pm-prd/inputs/repo-context.md`
2. List 2-3 facts you will cite in your problem statement.

## Part B: Draft the Problem Statement

**Task**: Draft a concise problem statement using the template.

1. Copy the PRD template into your workspace:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p practice/pm-prd
   cp docs/templates/prd.md practice/pm-prd/prd.md
   ```
2. Fill in the **Problem Statement** section in `practice/pm-prd/prd.md`.
3. Add at least two citations in the **Evidence / Sources** section.

## Part C: Self-Check

Use this checklist:
- Problem statement names the user and pain clearly
- Evidence is cited for each key claim
- The problem is stated without proposing solutions
