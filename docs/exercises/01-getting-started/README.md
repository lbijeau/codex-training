# Module 1 Exercises: Getting Started

These exercises build familiarity with Codex CLI before deeper modules.

## Checklist
- Install and authenticate Codex CLI (see `GETTING_STARTED.md`).
- Run a “hello world” Codex TUI session in a sandbox directory; approve/reject one command.
- Use `codex exec "list files"` in a safe directory to see non-interactive flow.
- Complete the hands-on labs in `docs/training/codex-cli-hands-on/`.

## What's Next After Module 1
- Proceed to [Module 2: Skills & Reusable Workflows](../../modules/02-skills.md) when you’re comfortable with the CLI.
